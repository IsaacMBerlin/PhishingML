# PhishingML
Phishing Machine Learning Research 

This code is part of a project made in conjunction with Minnetonka Highschool Research. This application takes in the 12 columns of data from kaggle.com, transforms it by parsing the useful data, scaling all the data from zero to one, and running a machine learning algorithm to predict if a website is a phish or not. As stated in the assosiated research paper, the algorithm was shown to be able to improve accuracy of finding phishing.
